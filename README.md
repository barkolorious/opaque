A portable device that measures the temperature, humidity, AQI (Air Quality Index), tVOC (total Volatile Organic Components), eCO2, CO, NH3, NOx and O3 amount in the air.

It comes in 2 flavours: OPAQUE Lite and OPAQUE Connect. OPAQUE Lite stores the measurements on device, in contrast to OPAQUE Connect, which stores data both on device and on cloud. OPAQUE Connect can also pull data from cloud.


It's still work in progress.
